Review the Program Specification

What does the program do?
- 3 choices of activities
    - breathing
    - reflection
    - listing

What user inputs does it have?
- input of time
- input of lists
- list of activity (menu)
- user answsers

What output does it produce?
- questions
- count down
- time animations
- breathing 
    - breathing in 
    - breathing out
- reflection 
    - not to repeat questions until all have been used (if want to do for expanded)
    - general prompt and followup questions for reflection
- listing  
    - users input of what they did

How does the program end?
- does a countdown
- quit 

---------------------------------------

Determine the classes

What are good candidates for classes in this program?
- MainActivities (abstract class)
- BreathingActivity (class)
- ReflectionActivity (class)
- ListingActivity (class)
- MainProgram (class)

What are the primary responsibilities of each class?
- MainActivities (abstract class)
    - list name of activity
    - share discription of activity
    - ask for duration
    - saying well done at end of program

- BreathingActivity (class)
    - duration
    - breathe in
    - breathe out
    - x ammount of time for breathing
    - well done

- ReflectionActivity (class)
    - receive a random question
    - receive a random prompt
    - press enter before ansking followup questions
    - duration
    - well done 

- ListingActivity (class)
    - duration
    - receive a random prompt
    - gather enteries from user
    - 

- MainProgram (class)
 - compiler of menu 
 - calls other classes
 - selection of choices

 ---------------------------------------

Define class behaviors

What are the behaviors this class will have in order to fulfill its responsibilities? 
(In other words, what things should this class do?)

- MainActivities (abstract class)
    - input for duration
    - explain what Activity is doing
    - well done message

- BreathingActivity (class)
    - run time from duration

- ReflectionActivity (class)
    - run 
    - get random prompt
    - get random question
    - display prompt
    - display question

- ListingActivity (class)
    - run
    - get random prompt
    - user input(s)
    
- MainProgram (class)
    - control menu
    - choose a number for activity or quit

---------------------------------------

Define class attributes

What attributes does this class need to fulfill its behaviors? 
(In other words, what variables should this class store?)

- MainActivities (abstract class)
    - hold name of activity
        - _name : string
    - description of each activity to display
        - _description: string
    - duration input
        - _duration: int 

- BreathingActivity (class)
    - NA 
- ReflectionActivity (class)
    - _prompt: string
    - _questions: string

- ListingActivity (class)
    - _count: int
    - _prompt: string

What are the data types of these member variables?
- look above

---------------------------------------

Define Constructors

What constructors should each class have?
- In other words, what parameters should you pass in when creating an object of that type.
- example
    public ReflectingActivity()
    {
        _name = "Reflecting";
        _description = "This activity will help you reflect on times ...";
        _duration = 50;

        // Set other values here that are unique to the Reflecting Activity
    }

What other work needs to be done to set up these objects?
- For example, does the constructor need to run code to perform set up tasks, 
like creating lists, iterating through variables, etc.

Review the Design

Are there any classes, methods, or variables, that you do not understand?
